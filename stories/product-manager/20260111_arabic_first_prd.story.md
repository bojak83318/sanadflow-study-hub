# User Story: Arabic-First PRD for SanadFlow

## As a
Product Manager

## I want to
Define a clear PRD for the SanadFlow Study Hub that prioritizes RTL support and collaborative diagramming

## So that
Engineering can implement the MVP with high fidelity to the students' needs

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PRD defines "Arabic-First" constraints for all UI components
- [ ] RTL cursor behavior is explicitly documented as a P0 requirement
- [ ] Collaborative diagramming is defined for I'rab sentence trees
- [ ] Onboarding flow for 5-10 pilot students is outlined
- [ ] Success metrics include "RTL Pass Rate" and "Zero Failure Sync"
